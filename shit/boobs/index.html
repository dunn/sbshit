Now, Noozhawk&rsquo;s J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings is back in the news with a short but insightful meditation on self-image and bodily autonomy. She recounts a question put to her recently by a female recipient of breast implants, <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randi_rabin_breasts_lead_way_husband_mail_order_bride_20131024" title="Randi Rabin: Woman's New Breasts Lead the Way; Wife Worried Husband Is Seeking Mail-Order Bride">who finds that her female friends have become &ldquo;standoffish&rdquo;</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I went from a 34C to a DD, and they are beautiful. I get lots of attention&mdash;usually from men, and most of them are my girlfriends&rsquo; husbands. How can I keep my friendship with the women in my life the way it used to be?</p> </blockquote> <p>The superficial reply to these concerns would involve a discussion of how women can uphold patriarchy by blaming other women for expressing their sexuality and &ldquo;tempting&rdquo; men, and also how women are belittled for pursuing breast augmentation while simultaneously being <a href="http://www.mrdestructo.com/2013/05/lets-talk-about-angelina-jolies-breasts.html" title="Let's Talk About Angelina Jolie's Breasts">valued only <em>for</em> their breasts</a>. The superficial recommendations to &ldquo;Betsy Boob&rdquo; might include that she refuse to be ashamed of her body and demand that her &ldquo;friends&rdquo; stop blaming her for the behavior of their husbands.</p> <p>But that would all be superficial. It would, in short, be the recommendation to <strong><em>LEAN IN</em></strong>. And we know by now that <a href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/feminisms-tipping-point-who-wins-from-leaning-in" title="Feminism's Tipping Point: Who Wins from Leaning in?">leaning in is not the answer to our problems</a>. Professor Rabin recognizes this, and accordingly recommends that Betsy Boob instead <em>lean back</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Try having an open discussion with your girlfriends about what is going on, and if by chance you are overly friendly with &ldquo;other women&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; you may need to step back a bit&mdash;literally.</p> </blockquote> <p>Randi Rabin understands that, aside from being a slogan for rich white women that ignores the structural issues that create inequality, the biggest problem with Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lean In&rdquo; movement was that it encouraged assertiveness and self-confidence in women. Rabin sagely warns that &ldquo;if you are wearing low cut, extremely revealing outfits and leading with your &lsquo;girls,&rsquo; rethink what kind of picture you want to paint here,&rdquo; reminding us that <a href="http://m.entrepreneur.com/article/225972" title="How Today's Young Female Entrepreneurs Embrace Their Feminine Mystique">feminism is dead</a> and that there are certain things that women <em>must not do</em>, such as love themselves unconditionally.</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2013-10-26 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">26 October 2013</time>. <a href="/shit">See more shit</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright Â© 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
