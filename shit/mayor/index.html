As our newly elected mayor, my first order of business will enure that all official correspondence takes the form of rhetorical questions.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s brush aside my qualifications and everything else that&rsquo;s relevant and discuss an issue the surface of which was barely scratched&mdash;the police chief&rsquo;s idea for a door-to-door campaign to discuss the &ldquo;homeless problem&rdquo;. If I am so adept at this art of misdirection already, will I not be an admirable politician?</p> <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve hitched my announcement of candidacy to a topic that will only interest the people who comment at the <em>Santa Barbara View</em>&mdash;how about we dishonestly suppose that such a campaign is motivated by some abstract principle, and then generalize that principle in the hopes of deriving some absurd conclusion?</p> <p>Doesn&rsquo;t it say something about my priorities that this is the most important thing I can think to write about?</p> <p>Most importantly, have you learned anything about me and my political views in this letter?</p> <p>Thank you for your time. I hope to see you at the next City Council meeting.</p> <p>&mdash; Reven C. Steynalds, <em>Santa Barbara</em></p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2013-08-10 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">10 August 2013</time>. <a href="/shit">See more shit</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright Â© 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
