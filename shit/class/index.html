Taking the form of a first-person narrative, the piece brilliantly parodies the tone-deafness of the wealthy and their ignorance of their own privilege, as well as touching on the problematic tendency of our media to serve as mouthpieces for local businesses.</p> <p>An excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p>Family trips and incessant summer barbecues and parties are the norm for our family in these wonderful warm months, and we always indulge and generally have a blast.</p> <p>But come Labor Day, man, I&rsquo;m straight burnt. Worn out. Beat down. Bushed. Bonked. Bagged. Zonked. Tuckered. Fried. Whipped. (I love my thesaurus.)</p> <p>I&rsquo;m typically looking forward to re-focusing on the office (gasp!) and putting some damned structure back into things. And the partying and vacationing and merrymaking is fun, very fun, but it&rsquo;s also grueling. (Punishing. Debilitating. Told you I love my thesaurus.) And this year was no different.</p> <p>In fact this year was particularly egregious.</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, though. Despite an absolutely crippling last couple of weeks that left me emotionally, mentally, and physically drained, I recently discovered a wonderful remedy that, when coupled with the aforementioned structure and focus, already has me reenergized and reinvigorated for the impending school year.</p> <p>What&rsquo;s the cure, you ask expectantly? What doctor is most likely to prescribe it?</p> <p>Spoiler alert, folks: It&rsquo;s not something you <em>take</em>, and there ain&rsquo;t no doctor who an give it to you.</p> <p>My cure is somewhere you <em>go</em>. Just for a night or two.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s simple, and it&rsquo;s right here in our collective backyard.</p> <p>Three(ish) words: <strong>Bacara Resort &amp; Spa.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Read the rest at <em>Santa Barbara Sentinel&rsquo;s</em> Issuu page (<a href="http://image.issuu.com/130830184014-057e3c6c253af0ab39fff9f252607560/jpg/page_1.jpg">page 1</a>, <a href="http://image.issuu.com/130830184014-057e3c6c253af0ab39fff9f252607560/jpg/page_2.jpg">page 2</a>, <a href="http://image.issuu.com/130830184014-057e3c6c253af0ab39fff9f252607560/jpg/page_11.jpg">page 3</a>, <a href="http://image.issuu.com/130830184014-057e3c6c253af0ab39fff9f252607560/jpg/page_28.jpg">page 4</a>, <a href="http://image.issuu.com/130830184014-057e3c6c253af0ab39fff9f252607560/jpg/page_30.jpg">page 5</a>).</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2013-09-06 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">6 September 2013</time>. <a href="/shit">See more shit</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright Â© 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
