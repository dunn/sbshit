And Other Smart Questions</h1> </header> <main id="content-start" role="main"> <section class="single"> <p>Local entrepreneur, inventor, columnist, engineer, guerrilla marketer and iconoclast Paul Burri is running out of ideas (<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/112512_paul_burri_have_nothing_to_say" title="When You Have Nothing to Say">this isn&rsquo;t the first time</a>). In his <em>Noozhawk</em> column, which he has apparently mistaken for a Tumblr, he&rsquo;s already written about that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/021013_paul_burri_the_great_frying_pan_mystery" title="Cracking the Case of the Great Frying Pan Mystery">poached an egg</a>, that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/012013_paul_burri_the_electric_blanket_mix-up" title="The Electric Blanket Mix-Up Unfolds">didn&rsquo;t make the bed correctly</a>, that time he went to Israel and <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/123012_paul_burri_recent_trip_to_israel" title="Observations After Our Recent Trip to Israel">decided that the Palestinians could learn a lot from the Israelis</a>, that time he got annoyed when <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/101412_paul_burri_why_didi_he_do_that" title="Questioning Why People Do the Things They Do">someone talked about him</a>, that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/081912_paul_burri_words_i_think_need_to_be_invented" title="Words I Think Need to Be Invented">made up words</a>, and that time when <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/042113_paul_burri_santa_barbara_homeless" title="An Unconventional Solution to Santa Barbara’s Transient Problem">he suggested that Santa Barbara conscript people into performing manual labor and then forcibly remove them from town</a>.</p> <p>There really isn&rsquo;t much more to talk about, but <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090212_paul_burri_man_killed_defective_toilet_seat" title="Man Killed by Defective Toilet Seat">that hasn&rsquo;t stopped dear Paul before</a>. This week Paul titled his piece <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_dumb_questions" title="Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions">&ldquo;Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions&rdquo;</a>, playing on <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-transcontinental-disability-choir-what-is-ableist-language-and-why-should-you-care" title="The Transcontinental Disability Choir: What is Ableist Language and Why Should You Care?">an ableist slur</a> to make the point that he has nothing interesting left to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I am in a lecture or an adult-ed class, my hand is always one of the first to go up when we get to the Q&amp;A part of the program. And often, afterward, people frequently come up to me and thank me for asking a question they were too timid to ask. I am sure that whatever question you have on your mind, there are several others in the audience who have the same question but hesitate because it might be a &ldquo;dumb question.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>At the risk of <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_whats_so_funny" title="What's So Funny?">explaining the joke</a>, this works on two levels. After having railed against the plague of &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; questions, it&rsquo;s suddenly revealed that Paul Burri asks a lot of them himself. And the people who have to answer his questions probably can&rsquo;t stop themselves from wishing he was dumb in the literal sense. But that wouldn&rsquo;t stop him from typing.</p> <p>I have nothing more to say about Paul Burri.</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2013-07-09 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">9 July 2013</time>. <a href="/shit">See more shit</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright © 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
