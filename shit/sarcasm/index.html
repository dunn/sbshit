Hendrickson, CM, AICA: Thank you for <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/saved-from-the-scourge-of-plastic-bags452524542/" title="Saved from the Scourge of Plastic Bags">saving us</a> from the scourge of going another week without something to make fun of in Santa Barbara (please do not read with any sarcasm, we&rsquo;re absolutely sincere and in fact have never been sarcastic ever).</p> <p>Perhaps now we can try to do something useful for the citizens and businesses in Santa Barbara&mdash;by laughing at your <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/saved-from-the-scourge-of-plastic-bags452524542/" title="Saved from the Scourge of Plastic Bags">letter to the editor</a>.</p> <p>I have attached a photo of the &ldquo;attached&rdquo; photos that you included with your letter. The fact that a web-only publication can fail, in 2013, to correctly embed images in a blog post paints a sad picture of what is allowed to happen when the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> is allowed to operate without regard to the impact on the community. I realize that using a PDF to display images is hardly a big deal except it seems to happen every day (unlike the presence of homeless individuals around Jed&rsquo;s business, given the gaps in his photographic record).</p> <figure> <img src="/img/pdf.png" alt="See pages 2–4, first page blank."/><figcaption>See pages 2–4, first page blank.</figcaption> </figure> <p>If it were not for us at <em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> I fear the City would take the <em>View</em> seriously.</p> <p>I ask the City Council to do more to marginalize the <a href="home.html" title="Point-Counterpoint: Kill the Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?">privileged and hateful</a> members of the local community in the Milpas Street area. <a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral Relativism">Sharon Byrne in particular</a> should be held to a strict standard (only one article or letter per month); police budgets should be slashed to reduce the victimization of the oppressed for the comfort of the rich; and finally the City needs to recognize the burden it carries as a government complicit in the continued production of conditions that create homelessness.</p> <figure> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/n3jzkYF.gif" alt="Artist’s rendition of Jed A.
