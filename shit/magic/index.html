It is a not question of perception, philosophy or sheer determination to decide how you want to perceive the world. This is not an interesting concept either since it&rsquo;s an expression and not a concept at all.</p> <p><strong>I would like to introduce a perception,</strong> which is different than the expressions and concepts previously introduced on account of it being a perception and not an expression or a concept.</p> <p>If you are feeling too negative, and the &ldquo;glass&rdquo; is always half empty for you … pour it out. Literally stop being negative.</p> <p>Sounds unachievable perhaps, and you might think this article is published on <em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> for a reason, but I have a book for you that is way worse.</p> <p>Our local author, Rhonda Byrne (relation to <a href="../liberal">Sharon Byrne</a> unknown) has written several books, The Magic is one that shifted much of my perception on how to write grammatically.</p> <p>While reading The Magic, <strong>I discovered a simple directive. Gratitude.</strong> Yes, it can be an actual verb, despite being a concept and not a word at all.</p> <p>You can do actual scientific experiments with this concept, like discovering a causal relationship between <a href="http://megr.im/post/lucidity">New Age nonsense and cultural appropriation</a>. There is even a science known as Spiritual Physics, assuming that &ldquo;science&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>science</em> and &ldquo;physics&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>physics</em>.</p> <p>I could end with a quote from Einstein about human stupidity, but ugh why bother.</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2014-03-18 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">18 March 2014</time>. <a href="/shit">See more shit</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright © 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
