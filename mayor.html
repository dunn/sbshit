<p><a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/letter_to_the_editor_announcing_write-in_candidacy_for_mayor_20130809">Dear Santa Barbara,</a></p>
<p>I’ve decided to enter the race for mayor as a write-in candidate. As our newly elected mayor, my first order of business will enure that all official correspondence takes the form of rhetorical questions.</p>
<p>Let’s brush aside my qualifications and everything else that’s relevant and discuss an issue the surface of which was barely scratched—the police chief’s idea for a door-to-door campaign to discuss the “homeless problem”. If I am so adept at this art of misdirection already, will I not be an admirable politician?</p>
<p>Now that I’ve hitched my announcement of candidacy to a topic that will only interest the people who comment at the <em>Santa Barbara View</em>—how about we dishonestly suppose that such a campaign is motivated by some abstract principle, and then generalize that principle in the hopes of deriving some absurd conclusion?</p>
<p>Doesn’t it say something about my priorities that this is the most important thing I can think to write about?</p>
<p>Most importantly, have you learned anything about me and my political views in this letter?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. I hope to see you at the next City Council meeting.</p>
<p>— Reven C. Steynalds, <em>Santa Barbara</em></p>
