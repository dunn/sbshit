Law enforcement is perceived by many to take the side of those <em>perpetrating</em> hate crimes, instead of those victimized by them.</p> <p>In the wake of this story, the <em>Nexus</em> was not silent. In today&rsquo;s op-ed, Emile Nelson and R. Pengsta have a message for the <a href="http://queerumich.com/post/25021141159/lgbt-lgbtq-queer-quiltbag-gsm-gsrm-whats" title="Queer \@ UMich: LGBT? LGBTQ? Queer? QUILTBAG? GSM? GSRM?">GSRM</a> community at UCSB:</p> <p><a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/to-hump-or-not-to-hump-he-said-she-said-edition/" title="To Hump or Not to Hump? He Said, She Said Edition"><strong>Go away.</strong></a></p> <p>Smoothly articulating the principles behind <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=101961#renewing" title="Daily Nexus Mission Statement">the mission statement of the <em>Nexus</em></a>, Nelson and Pengsta bravely defend commonsense heterosexual values against the &ldquo;compulsory homosexuality&rdquo; taught in liberal universities such as UCSB. They also unapologetically reaffirm the Biblical truth that men and women are irredeemably different creatures, each incomprehensible to the other.</p> <p>Nelson and Pengsta therefore present their polemic as a dialogue, with Pengsta as the straight woman speaking to other straight women who chase after men, and Nelson <a href="../batman" title="Batman is Best at Everything, Including Fighting the Matriarchy">reprising his role</a> as the misogynistic fuckwit who slut-shames his female peers. Discussing the Serious Problem of having sex on a first date, Nelson <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/to-hump-or-not-to-hump-he-said-she-said-edition/" title="To Hump or Not to Hump? He Said, She Said Edition">pontificates finely</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>[I]t&rsquo;s risky to light the candles and whip out the Marvin Gaye on day one for a couple of reasons.</p> <ol> <li><p>Sleaze factor: You can&rsquo;t help but wonder that if she&rsquo;s ready for me on day one, who else is getting this kind of treatment?</p></li> <li><p>The Natural Order: It&rsquo;s much easier to become friends before the first hump than it is to try to go back and get to know each other afterwards. You might feel satisfied, but you&rsquo;ll probably never know if she shares your love for Batman.</p></li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>Nelson is of course perfectly correct that if a woman has had sex with multiple (male!) partners she&rsquo;s thereby worthless, but that point has been made more eloquently elsewhere. His second itemized bit of 19th-century wisdom is rather more original.</p> <p>It is a truth long-forgotten that men and women can only engage in normal relations (&ldquo;be friends&rdquo;, to use the jargon) when they are not and have never been engaged in abnormal relations (have not &ldquo;fucked each others&rsquo; brains out&rdquo;)&mdash;and <a href="http://jezebel.com/5954769/for-the-love-of-god-will-we-ever-stop-asking-if-men-and-women-can-be-ever-be-just-friends" title="For the Love of God, Will We Ever Stop Asking if Men and Women Can Really Be \'Just Friends\'?">perhaps not even then!</a> Once the man has taken the woman as his, she is no longer his equal and it is inappropriate and emasculating for him to &ldquo;talk to her&rdquo; and &ldquo;care about her opinion&rdquo; concerning Batman and similarly intellectual subjects.</p> <p>So, by-definition-heterosexual <strong>Ladies:</strong> do you want to talk about Batman with Emile Nelson? Then for the love of God, don&rsquo;t have sex with him. But don&rsquo;t have sex with anyone else either, since that would make you a ruined trollop, unworthy of his attention.</p> <p>Maybe just don&rsquo;t talk to Emile Nelson.</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2013-05-15 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">15 May 2013</time>. <a href="/nonsense">See more nonsense</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright Â© 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
