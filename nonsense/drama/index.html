Our writers have referred to them as a <a href="../nonsense" title="Announcement of the launch of The Daily Nonsense on Baruffio.com">&ldquo;cabal of hacks&rdquo;</a> who publish <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn/status/327667602971320320" title="Tweet by @dunndunndunn on 25 April 2013">&ldquo;racist garbage&rdquo;</a>. So it was not particularly surprising that they eventually made an official response. What was surprising was when and how this response was made, and the heartwarming ending to the ensuing affair.</p> <p><em>The Daily Nonsense</em> was launched yesterday to much acclaim. The most evident testimony of its immediate impact was the reaction from a group of campus Republicans, who went back in time <em>over 40 years</em> to start a competing publication. These scoundrels founded &ldquo;The Daily Nexus&rdquo; in order to undermine our credibility and dilute our brand. For decades they prepared for the day when they would use their clout to strike the <em>Nonsense</em> down on the very day it launched.</p> <p>That day came.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We're finally on @<a href="https://twitter.com/twitter">twitter</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23socialmedia">#socialmedia</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23brands">#brands</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23tcot">#tcot</a> <a href="http://t.co/Nf3n7Ms18b" title="http://baruffio.com/ds/">baruffio.com/ds/</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Nonsense (@thedailynexus) <a href="https://twitter.com/thedailynexus/status/328254426647248896">April 27, 2013</a></blockquote> <p>By launching on a weekend, we attempted to catch the <em>Nexus</em> off-guard and establish ourselves as the only legitimate news source:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>NB: Campus Republicans are trying to dilute our brand by squatting on the @<a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus">dailynexus</a> account. They are NOT the Daily Nonsense!</p>&mdash; The Daily Nonsense (@thedailynexus) <a href="https://twitter.com/thedailynexus/status/328256959952347138">April 27, 2013</a></blockquote> <p>Late that night, they struck. We at the <em>Nonsense</em> knew what was coming as soon as the <em>Nexus</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328373627819028480" title="Tweet from @dailynexus on 27 April 2013">tweeted a link to an article</a> titled &ldquo;Seth Rogen enjoys being in control&rdquo;. We were threatening the <em>Nexus&rsquo;</em> <strong>control</strong> over the UCSB news cycle, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328374159220539392" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013">they were not pleased</a>:</p> <p><img src="/img/dn_wtf.png" alt="Screenshot taken by our Managing Editor and feline mascot [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn &quot;Twitter&quot;)" title="The Daily Nexus replies to our tweet with \&quot;what the fuck\&quot;"/> </p> <p>After 40 years of hegemony the <em>Nexus</em> was suddenly experiencing real competition. Having become so accustomed to being on top, they panicked and lashed out. It became clear that <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328376801854369792" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013">they were confused</a>, no longer sure how to respond:</p> <p><img src="/img/dn_what.png" alt="Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn &quot;Twitter&quot;)" title="Tweets: @dunndunndunn asks \&quot;gosh what's up with the daily nexus\&quot; and @dailynexus replies \&quot;good question\&quot;"/> </p> <p>Finally comprehending the magnitude of our superiority, they <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328376961317613568" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013">acknowledged defeat</a>:</p> <p><img src="/img/dn_good.png" alt="Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn &quot;Twitter&quot;)" title="@dailynexus to @thedailynexus: \&quot;good one\&quot;"/> </p> <p>After some hasty negotiations, it was decided that the <em>Nexus</em> would become a subsidiary of the <em>Nonsense</em>. As part of the agreement, they began retweeting our content:</p> <p><img src="/img/dn_tcot.jpg" alt="Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn &quot;Twitter&quot;)" title="@dailynexus retweets @thedailynexus"/> </p> <p><img src="/img/dn_cat.jpg" alt="Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn &quot;Twitter&quot;)" title="@dailynexus retweets @dunndunndunn"/> </p> <p>But the merger was not entirely painless. Certain comments by one of our writers <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328382045577433089" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus on 27 April 2013">rankled the <em>Nexus</em> staff</a>:</p> <p><img src="/img/dn_really.jpg" alt="Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn &quot;Twitter&quot;)" title="Tweets: @dunndunndunn says \&quot;The @dailynexus is publishing more racist garbage\&quot; and @dailynexus replies \&quot;really now\&quot;"/> </p> <p>That is rather inflammatory! In addition, the article in question was found, <a href="../pc" title="\&quot;What Do Words Mean?\&quot;">on closer examination</a>, to be a work of biting <em>anti-racist</em> satire. <strong>We therefore apologized to Mark Strong and the <em>Nexus</em> for the remarks of our feline mascot, and do so publicly again.</strong></p> <p>That misunderstanding aside, all is well between us:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">dunndunndunn</a> &lt;3</p>&mdash; Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328385484080443392">April 28, 2013</a></blockquote> <p>The future looks bright for the joint <em>Nonsense/Nexus</em>. Going forward we will be officially merging into a single publication known as the <strong>Noxious</strong>.
