Let us refer to the ghostly narrator as &ldquo;Edwin&rdquo;:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am dead.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the words of one commenter, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/comment-page-1/#comment-172755">&ldquo;Cool story, bro.&rdquo;</a></p> <p>But how did Edwin die?</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s one pill, man?&rdquo; said my friend. &ldquo;People take six of those a day for pain.&rdquo; I looked at it. It was white, oval-shaped and promised a good time. Two hours later I was in bed, unable to breathe. My friends thought I was just passed out&mdash;something that happens a lot at college parties. Hell, I had seen it so many times too! Why would something go wrong then?</p> </blockquote> <p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that Edwin isn&rsquo;t the brightest bulb, but it&rsquo;s rather alarming that Dr Feliciano doesn&rsquo;t pause in his spirit-channeling to point out that there are rather a lot of reasons why <em>something would go wrong</em> when a person passes out at a party. I can only assume that the good doctor knows something we don&rsquo;t (and I guess that&rsquo;s to be expected, given that <em>he&rsquo;s</em> the one who can commune with the dead).</p> <blockquote> <p>When the doctors discussed my &ldquo;case&rdquo; after I died, one doc said, &ldquo;This is outrageous. Too many kids die from this. How stupid can a person be?&rdquo; I was angry, but I hung around and listened to their &ldquo;expert analysis.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Expert&rdquo; is rightly enclosed in quotation marks, because these doctors probably don&rsquo;t even believe in ghosts. But more interesting are the quotes around &ldquo;case&rdquo;. What is Dead Edwin trying to tell us? Was there no real case? Let us proceed with caution, dear reader.</p> <p>The dead man&rsquo;s story continues with some bizarrely pedagogic ruminations on his so-called case, and the claim that &ldquo;what I learned may help you stay alive.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a rather strange thing to tell a doctor, but Edwin Feliciano apparently doesn&rsquo;t realize that a passed-out person might be in trouble, so I suppose he could use the advice.</p> <p>As we reach the conclusion, though, a careful reader gets the impression that this is not the monologue of a normal (if deceased) 19-year-old:</p> <blockquote> <p>The rest of the explanation got too technical for me. By then, I didn&rsquo;t care to understand the &ldquo;physiological&rdquo; causes of my death. It boiled down to this: there is a difference between what you feel psychologically&mdash;relaxed, buzzed, happy&mdash;and what your body is experiencing internally. While it may be easy to gauge your mood, alcohol and drugs are accumulating in your system at a rate faster than your body can metabolize them. The fact is that the effects are delayed, so when you have one more shot, or an Adderall, or a Norco, you&rsquo;re creating a unique, often deadly cocktail in your body. That&rsquo;s what happened to me. I got the message too late, which is, very simply, that mixing drugs will kill you, period.</p> <p>I should have stayed home watching the Sixers play the Knicks and having a few beers with my friends. I didn&rsquo;t, as you now know, but you have a choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sounds less like the lament of a soul who is mourning the loss of its body than a school psychiatrist who is insulting the intelligence of his patients by making obviously false claims that lead students to dismiss his advice&mdash;and therefore be <em>more</em> likely to make risky decisions&mdash;instead of explaining accurately how common drugs interact and urging young people to educate themselves about the effects of what they put in their bodies.</p> <p>So maybe ghosts don&rsquo;t exist after all. They&rsquo;re just another thing Dr Feliciano made up to scare us.</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2013-05-22 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">22 May 2013</time>. <a href="/nonsense">See more nonsense</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright © 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
