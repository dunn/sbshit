Maybe that&rsquo;s what happened, and maybe it&rsquo;s not, but the news cycle doesn&rsquo;t wait and thinkpieces won&rsquo;t write themselves. Those of us who thought we could escape Deltopia by staying out of IV last weekend were sorely mistaken.</p> <hr/> <p>Associated Students was quick of the gate with <a href="http://t.e2ma.net/message/8xhfld/w4ircf">an email to UCSB students</a> that said, in effect, Quit Inviting Your Shitty High-School Friends To Our Parties You <em>Dicks.</em> A few days later they provided a <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2014/apr/08/statement-events-isla-vista-april-5th-2014/">modified statement to the media</a> that more or less said What The Fuck Just Happened Man, Damn.</p> <p>Dissatisfied with AS&rsquo;s even-handed approach, graduate student Patrick Mooney took the opportunity to remind us why nobody takes academics seriously by writing a <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2014/04/op-ed-graduate-student-and-ta-speaks-out-on-deltopia-2014-riot">a ponderous op-ed in <em>The Bottom Line</em></a> arguing that a 17-year-old from Los Angeles assaulted a police officer because the UC system has recently been making administrative decisions without sufficient student input. Wash the taste of that piece out your mouth with <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/ucsb_student_offers_perspective_on_8216deltopia8217_mayhem_20140406">this first-hand account of Saturday night</a> by undergraduate Alexa Shapiro, who identifies some important failures of the police response.</p> <p><strong>More student takes:</strong> Probably the emptiest piece came from <a href="/nonsense/sexy"><em>Nonsense</em> favorite</a> Ben Moss, who took <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/deltopia-revisited/">7 paragraphs</a> to write &ldquo;lol woops I was wrong,&rdquo; which, admittedly, is more than most professional columnists are willing to do. A political science major <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/deltopia-2014-not-so-black-and-white-after-all/">screamed a lot about stuff</a> and got a nice kerfuffle going in the comments. And, <em>of course,</em> someone managed to blame the riot on a <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/54745/">pregnant black woman</a>, because of course.</p> <p>Not all students are garbage, though, as Lily Kingsbury demonstrates with this <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/lily_kingsbury_open_letter_to_isla_vista_20140411">nice piece about Isla Vista and community</a>.</p> <hr/> <p>After all that you&rsquo;re probably thinking Hey They&rsquo;re Just Young, They&rsquo;ll Grow Up And Be Smart.</p> <p>Haha, no.</p> <p>&ldquo;UC parent&rdquo; Adam Sparks <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/bring-back-floatopia/">innocently wonders</a> Why Oh Why was Floatopia canceled in the first place, if we&rsquo;d just let the kids have their <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2009/apr/09/isla-vistas-floatopia-fiasco/">beach fun</a> none of this would have happened. An alumnus issued a <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/letter-to-all-of-those-with-ties-to-the-isla-vista-community/">stuffy whitepaper</a> that at least did offer some concrete proposals. The <em>Santa Barbara View</em> couldn&rsquo;t decide whether to commission a philosophical meditation from <a href="/shit/liberal" title="A New Argument for Moral Relativism">moral relativist Sharon Byrne</a> or a sermon from <a href="/shit/porn" title="A Comedy of Errors">concern troll Loretta Redd, PhD</a>, so they just solicited &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; in an <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/weekend-review-deltopia524245425/">open thread</a>, with predictable results. But none of the <em>View</em> commenters could hope to match the Final Solution offered by UCSB engineer <a href="http://me.ucsb.edu/contacts/greg-dahlen">Greg Dahlen</a>, who literally <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2014/apr/11/ss-emdeltopiaem/">called for the murder of 15,000 people</a> in the <em>Santa Barbara Independent.</em></p> <hr/> <p>So next time you find yourself thinking how terrible kids are these days, know that they&rsquo;ll only get worse with age. That&rsquo;s the real lesson of Deltopia.</p> </section> <hr/> <footer><p> Posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">Alex Dunn</a> on <time datetime="2014-04-11 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">11 April 2014</time>. <a href="/nonsense">See more nonsense</a>.</p> </footer> </main> <footer role="contentinfo"> <p>Content copyright Â© 2014 Alex Dunn. <a title="Main page" href="/">Go to the main page</a>.</p> </footer> </body> </html>
