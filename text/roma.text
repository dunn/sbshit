had a chilling effect on other American racists.  How are they to
exercise their right to
[free speech](https://twitter.com/squeenlatifah/status/350024436939898881
"Tweet by @squeenlatifa on 26 June 2013") when there are such
consequences?  Your average racist could not be blamed for simply
packing it in.

But Julia Chaplin is not your average racist.  Her bigotry is
sophisticated and subtle, as demonstrated by
[a recent feature in *Santa Barbara Magazine*](http://sbmag.com/2013/06/bohemian-rhapsody/
"Bohemian Rhapsody").  The "style" she promotes involves some
egregious cultural appropriation, particularly against Indigenous
American peoples, and her books are boldly titled with the portmanteau
["gypset"](http://www.gypset.com/), the combination of "jet-set" and a
[racial slur used against the Romani people](http://www.rsdb.org/race/gypsy
"The Racial Slur Database entry for \"gypsy\"").  But none of this is
mentioned in the interview; Chaplin and "her band of friends, artists,
musicians, and otherworldly vivants" are described as "a disheveled,
chic, colorfully elegant tribe that turns heads".

How did Julia Chaplin get away with this sort of behavior in our
politically-correct dystopia?  We sat down with her (*we did not*) and
asked her how to be racist after Paula Deen.

[**CAT:**](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn "Twitter for @dunndunndunn") First off, congratulations.

**JC:** Thank you!  In a time when you can get in trouble for
[using stock photography instead of finding a single image of a feminist of color](http://thisweekinblackness.com/2013/07/01/white-feminists-netroots/
"This Week in Blackness: White Feminists: Step Your Game Up"), I feel
like I've really beat the odds here.

**CAT:** How do you think you got away with perpetuating racist
stereotypes against *multiple* groups with very little protest?  During my
exhaustive research I found only one

and a

**JC:** There are a few things I did that Paula Deen failed to do.
First, the groups I went after are even more marginalized than the
Black community is.  Racism directed at Indigenous and
[Romani](http://gypsyappropriations.blogspot.com/2010/07/truth-about-gypsy-life.html
"The Truth About \'Gypsy Life\'") peoples remains acceptable in a way
anti-Black racism isn't.  Remember that just recently
[a music festival was hosted in your own backyard](../docs/lucidity.html
"When You\'re Lucid Dreaming You Can Do Anything But That Includes
Being Racist") that engaged in blatant appropriation of various
Indigenous cultures, and another local magazine devoted
[half an issue](http://www.ventanamonthly.com/issue.php?IssueNum=79
"Ventana Magazine: On the Gypsy Trail") to playing on
[the racist trope of "gypsy magic."](https://staticnonsense.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/tw-the-bullshit-of-gypsy-magic-in-the-pagan-community/
"[tw] the bullshit of \'gypsy magic\' in the pagan community").

**CAT:** Good points.  And there's probably something to be said for
committing some appropriation against different groups, rather than
going all-in on one.

**JC:** Exactly, you want to diffuse the response.  There's no one group
that I've single-mindedly victimized; that was the mistake of Lucidity
Festival.

**CAT:** So the lessons are to choose multiple groups that remain
incredibly vulnerable and spread the damage around.

**JC:** Correct!

**CAT:** Well, this has been very enlightening.  Thank you so much for
your time.

**JC:** It's been a pleasure.
