In contemporary philosophy it often seems as if
[all possible views](https://twitter.com/possibleviews "@possibleviews
on Twitter") have been formulated and defended.  It's been argued that
only the present exists, that the past *and* future exist (and thus
that dinosaurs and future people exist too), that Sherlock Holmes
really exists, and that *we* don't exist.  One Christian philosopher
has even suggested that when we die, God exchanges our corpse with a
perfect copy; the copy decomposes in the earth but we remain intact,
to allow for reincarnation.

But despite this plurality of bizarre opinions, there is a reasonable
amount of consensus on certain issues related to material things and
their parts.  Everyday objects like tables, chairs, cars, and
televisions are generally agreed to be built up out of parts: I can
disassemble a car into its tires, engine, doors, etc.  In that sense,
the car exists because its parts are put together in the right way; if
they are not assembled correctly, there is no car.  The car is not
*basic*.

Noticing this unusual consensus, a certain
[Scott Wenz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS5__yFW5EE "CARSAREBASIC
Interview 1OF4") has boldly staked out an opposing view in pursuit of
fame and articles that might get accepted for publication in *The
Philosophical Quarterly*.  He has recently made the exciting claim
that **cars *are* basic**.

Extraordinary!

Perhaps believing that his radical ideas will not be received warmly
by the philosophical establishment, Wenz has---like
[David Birnbaum](https://chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/the-strangest-conference-i-ever-attended/32805
"The Strangest Conference I Ever Attended")---sought to advance his
theory outside the confines of academia.  He has even started
[his own nonprofit](http://www.carsarebasic.org/ "Cars Are Basic") in
order to better reach a receptive audience.

Scott Wenz's theory is complicated and highly abstract, but he has
made admirable efforts to explain the essential points in
[clear, straightforward language](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/letter_to_the_editor_high-speed_rail_bart_and_santa_barbara_connected/
"Letter to the Editor: High-Speed Rail, BART and Santa Barbara
Connected?").  He begins his prÃ©cis by explaining why such things
as the [Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)](http://www.bart.gov/),
high-speed rail, and buses are *not* basic:

> [1] An Associated Press article printed Monday states that BART General
> Manager Dorothy Dugger resigned under presser [sic] in May 2011, but
> collected $330,000 in pay and additional benefits that included two
> added months of vacation!
>
> BART is part of the heavily subsidized and expensive commuter rail
> system that has failed in the San Jose area and has questionable
> ridership outside of the San Francisco Bay.

The main thrust of Wenz's theory is starting to emerge.  Trains and
buses (and bikes!) are not basic because their usability requires
government support.  The operation of trains and buses and the
infrastructure required for bicycles must be provided by the
government.  But the government is inherently corrupt, so these
non-basic forms of transportation are inherently flawed and should not
be funded.  (There was literally
[nothing California could have done](http://web.archive.org/web/20120715031917/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-rail-advice-20120709,0,973921,full.story
"LA Times: High-speed rail officials rebuffed proposal from French
railway") to make high-speed rail work.)

Cars, on the other hand, *are* basic, according to Wenz.  My use of a
car does not depend on the government in any way.  I purchase a car
from a private dealer, I *certainly* do not register it, I siphon gas
rather than pay the gas tax, and I drive it wherever I choose.  It is
that *freedom* provided by cars that
[makes them basic](http://www.carsarebasic.org/mission.html "Mission
Statement for Cars Are Basic"):

> The right to ***choose*** the mode of transportation is at the core
> of a free society.  Designing and maintaining ***core routes*** with
> capacity to efficiently handle vehicles, allowing for safe and
> flexible personal transportation decisions is essential.

Freedom to choose.  In a free society, everyone is able to choose how
they travel: by Ford, Honda, Toyota, or any of the many fine brands of
automobile that truly *anyone* can afford.  The criterion of liberty
is having this *personal transportation decision*---and what more
could one want?
