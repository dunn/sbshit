Our local writers are masters of dissimulation and double meaning.
They brilliantly hide a progressive message behind overblown,
reactionary rhetoric.  Harry Schutle
[pretended to be an ignorant racist](fallacy.html "Critical Thinking
for Racists") while in fact spotlighting the fallacies in racist
thought.  Randi Rabin
[feigned interest in idiotic questions](friends.html "The Case of the
Magical Magnetic Genitals") so as to undermine cis- and
heteronormativity.  And most recently, Sharon Byrne pretended to write
[a high-school-level paper on political philosophy](liberal.html "A
New Argument for Moral Relativism") while actually making a novel
argument for moral relativism.  (Byrne goes so far as to
[stay in character on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SantaBarbaraBullshit/posts/10201690114437674?notif_t=share_wall_create
"Lucy Sharon Byrne's post on Santa Barbara Bullshit on 20 July
2013")!)

But Harris Sherline has written the most subtle piece yet, an essay
ostensibly concerning the living wage that is really a profound
meditation on the problems at the heart of capitalism.

Sherline uses another article as his jumping-off point:

> A recent article in the *Washington Post* reporting that Washington,
> D.C., is considering mandating a "living wage" caught my attention.

He then spends over one quarter of his column quoting nearly five full
paragraphs of
[the *Post* story](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/wal-mart-says-it-will-pull-out-of-dc-plans-should-city-mandate-living-wage/2013/07/09/4fa7e710-e8d0-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_story.html
"Wal-Mart says it will pull out of D.C. plans should city mandate
'living wage'"), without actually linking to the story itself.
Sherline is clearly trying to make the point that *he* is not being
paid enough by *Noozhawk* to write his column.  And by failing to link
back to the *Post* he draws attention to fact that there are no
editors at *Noozhawk* who are able to catch such basic mistakes (or
use block quotes where necessary).

After finishing his copy-and-paste protest, Sherline becomes rather
pensive:

> I've never been a fan of the "living wage" policy, which I believe
> causes more problems than it solves.
>
> For one thing, does anyone know how much a "living wage" should be?
> After all, one man's "living wage" may well be another's poverty
> wage.

It is immediately clear that Sherline is not actually asking this
question in earnest, because doing so would violate the conversational
maxim of "Do Not Solemnly Ask Questions That Can Be
[Answered In Ten Seconds With Google](http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083
"Living Wage Calculation for Santa Barbara County, California")".
Rather, he is trying to make a larger point, as we can see with his
next question:

> So, just what amount of compensation is necessary to provide an
> adequate living, and who should make that decision?  It appears that
> many city and county governing boards have become the
> decision-makers in such matters---rather than the free market.
>
> Although the concept [of a living wage] has been around for a while
> and was adopted by the City of Santa Barbara in 2005, I have yet to
> see a clear statement of what it actually is.

Again, Sherline must be tending towards something of a philosophic
nature, because one is not licensed to say something like "I have yet
to see such-and-such" unless such-and-such is not
[easily accessible on the internet](http://povertyinamerica.mit.edu/projects/living_wage/
"Living Wage Project").

Sherline begins to reveal his ultimate purpose when he mentions the
work of the
[Employment Policies Institute](http://www.propublica.org/article/rotten-acorn-ad-funded-by-anti-minimum-wage-group
"\"Rotten\" ACORN Ad Funded by Anti-Minimum Wage Group"), a group
funded by businesses for the sole purpose of lowering the minimum wage
(and who, to that end, spearheaded the
[smear campaign](http://www.epionline.org/study/r113/ "Rotten ACORN:
America's Bad Seed") that helped destroy ACORN).  Sherline's purpose
in citing this indefensible organization might seem puzzling at first,
but it must be taken in conjunction with his earlier claim that the
living wage "is nothing more than a minimum wage packaged under
another label and justified as 'economic justice'."

So there we are.  The living wage is a "bad idea" because it is simply
another version of the minimum wage, something that has been combated
so effectively by the Employment Policies Institute along with the
rest of the right.  Living wage laws will not ensure economic justice
because there *cannot* be economic justice under a capitalist system
that allows laws to be covertly influenced by corporate interests.
Living wage laws are reformist approaches that merely slow the
impoverishment of the lower classes while promoting a false sense of
security.

Harris Sherline demands more than reform.  He demands revolution.
Join Comrade Sherline in bringing down capitalism, for only then will
we have true economic justice!
