Our [last piece](wage.html "What Is The Point Of A Living Wage If We
Are Not Truly Alive") examined the way local writers cleverly hide
their progressive politics behind superficially reactionary claims.
Harris Sherline in particular showed himself to be a master of hiding
his revolutionary anti-capitalism behind boilerplate corporate
rhetoric.  An uncritical reader might misunderstand him, but his
radical meaning was clear to those to were ready to hear it.

Now, however, *Noozhawk* has printed a real puzzler.  Randy Alcorn has
used his column to pose a curious question: "[[The] Trayvon Martin
Case---Racism or
Reality?](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randy_alcorn_trayvon_martin_case_racism_or_reality
"Randy Alcorn: Trayvon Martin Case---Racism or Reality?")  Such a
question *seems* to imply that racism doesn't actually exist, and that
Serious People who are grounded in reality ignore the centuries-old
system of oppression that continues to position Black people as
second-class citizens.

But that can't be what Randy is *actually* saying.  There's no way
he's *that* willfully ignorant of racism in the United States today,
and of his own complicity in its perpetuation.

No way.  So let's dig a little deeper and see if we can figure out
what he's really getting at.

> Yes, racial profiling of black men, especially young black men, is
> common in America, but is it a manifestation of persistent,
> widespread racism?  While racism certainly still exists in America,
> its pervasiveness is questionable.  The vast majority of nonblack
> Americans are not racist, especially the younger generation, as
> Obama mentioned, for whom race is virtually a nonfactor.

Randy must be trying to imply something else here, because there's no
other reason why he would utter such a blatant falsehood.  Everyone
raised in a racist society will more or less frequently perpetuate
that racism, and because the US is still *profoundly* racist, young
people are no exception.  Indeed, those born after 1980 may be even
*more* prone to actions that prop up racist oppression, given that
they have been taught to think only of
[interpersonal *prejudice* as opposed to *systemic racism*](http://thegrio.com/2011/08/10/milennials-attiudes-prove-america-isnt-post-racial/
"The Grio: Millennial attitudes prove America isn't post-racial"):

(This is the legacy of the right's "reverse racism" talking point.)

Perhaps Randy's point here about race being a "nonfactor" is that many
white people have convinced themselves that we live in a "post-racial"
society where they don't need to confront their own privilege.

Moving along:

This is very strange, given that the country is still
[deeply segregated](http://www.propublica.org/article/reading-guide-segregation-in-america
"ProPublica reading guide: Segregation in America"), with schools
possibly *less* integrated than in the 1960s.  But I suppose it is
indeed comforting to know that in 2010 only
[17 percent](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/5/#chapter-4-public-attitudes-on-intermarriage
"The Rise of Intermarriage: Public Attitudes on Intermarriage") of
those responding to a Pew Survey were willing to openly voice their
disapproval of Blacks and whites dating, while a mere 11 percent
claimed that increasing rates of intermarriage were a bad thing.

My guess is that Randy Alcorn here is *pretending* to be one of those
commenters who points out unapologetic racist behavior as the "real"
racism in order to deflect attention from their brand of [dog-whistle
racism that is more easily denied](http://gawker.com/5899322/the-dog-whistle-has-sounded-how-the-right-talks-about-thugs-like-trayvon-martin
"The Dog Whistle Has Sounded: How the Right Talks About 'Thugs' Like
Trayvon Martin").

But I'm still not sure what Randy's ultimate purpose is.  Maybe
reading further will clear things up:

> "The stark reality is that crime happens in communities of color,"
> New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in a recent ABC
> Nightline broadcast. He went on to say, "About 70 percent to 75
> percent of the people described as committing violent crimes---
> assault, robbery, shootings, grand larceny---are described as being
> African-American."

Most likely Randy is citing
[compulsive liar Ray Kelly](http://www.salon.com/2013/07/23/kelly_stop_and_frisk_and_muslim_surveillance_are_wonderful/
"Kelly's creative writing: Stop-and-frisk and Muslim surveillance are
wonderful!") in order to remind us both that statistics given to us
by the police may exaggerate Black criminality, and that that racist
police state that Ray Kelly champions may well be a major *cause* of
crime in poor Black communities, by robbing young people of
opportunity and hope.

Very good points, but I'm still not finding the thread tying this all
together.  Here's Randy again:

> Was Martin profiled by Zimmerman?  Most probably.  Did Zimmerman
> have reason to be cautiously suspicious of Martin?  Given the
> realities of who commits crime in America, yes.

It's difficult to pinpoint why Randy feels the need to repeat the lie
that Black communities should be willing to take on a "racist
public-safety tax" after it has been so well
[refuted by Ta-Nehisi Coates](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/the-banality-of-richard-cohen-and-racist-profiling/277871/
"The Banality of Richard Cohen and Racist Profiling"):

> New York City's murder rate is as low as it has been in 50 years.
> How long should a racist public-safety tax last?  Until black people

(In other words, "Black-on-Black" crime is the rhetorical device by
which the fact that
[violence occurs between neighbors in our segregated society](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/15/the-trayvon-martin-killing-and-the-myth-of-black-on-black-crime.html
"The Trayvon Martin Killing and the Myth of Black-on-Black Crime") is
transformed into an indictment of Blackness itself.)

I'm becoming increasingly confused, and there's not much left of
Randy's column:

> Had Zimmerman not been armed and Martin had severely beaten him,
> maybe killing him or leaving him disabled, would this case have
> commanded such ongoing national attention?

Once again I must admit to being rather nonplussed by Randy's (surely
tongue-in-cheek) invocation of a racist trope.  If Martin had been the
aggressor rather than Zimmerman, he would have been immediately
arrested and jailed, rather than allowed to walk free and only
apprehended six weeks later after sustained protests.  You can't just
flip the races of the attacker and victim and pretend that the
sequence of events would have remained the same.  To so pretend is
just another method by which the effects of racism are minimized.

I'm thoroughly bewildered.  And the last paragraph doesn't help
things:

> The racism industry and the media vultures cannot bank on old white
> guilt forever.  White America is not responsible for black behavior,
> black America is.

I can only assume that Randy is trying to write a clever parody of
[Richard Cohen's appalling piece for the *Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-racism-vs-reality/2013/07/15/4f419eb6-ed7a-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html
"Racism vs. reality"), which he titled "Racism vs. reality".  

But it's really not very funny.
