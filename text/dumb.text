Local entrepreneur, inventor, columnist, engineer, guerrilla marketer
and iconoclast Paul Burri is running out of ideas
([this isn't the first time](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/112512_paul_burri_have_nothing_to_say
"When You Have Nothing to Say")).  In his *Noozhawk* column, which he
has apparently mistaken for a Tumblr, he's already written about that
time he
[poached an egg](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/021013_paul_burri_the_great_frying_pan_mystery
"Cracking the Case of the Great Frying Pan Mystery"), that time he
[didn't make the bed correctly](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/012013_paul_burri_the_electric_blanket_mix-up
"The Electric Blanket Mix-Up Unfolds"), that time he went to Israel
and
[decided that the Palestinians could learn a lot from the Israelis](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/123012_paul_burri_recent_trip_to_israel
"Observations After Our Recent Trip to Israel"), that time he got
annoyed when
[someone talked about him](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/101412_paul_burri_why_didi_he_do_that
"Questioning Why People Do the Things They Do"), that time he
[made up words](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/081912_paul_burri_words_i_think_need_to_be_invented
"Words I Think Need to Be Invented"), and that time when
[he suggested that Santa Barbara conscript people into performing manual labor and then forcibly remove them from town](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/042113_paul_burri_santa_barbara_homeless
"An Unconventional Solution to Santa Barbaraâ€™s Transient Problem").

There really isn't much more to talk about, but
[that hasn't stopped dear Paul before](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090212_paul_burri_man_killed_defective_toilet_seat
"Man Killed by Defective Toilet Seat").  This week Paul titled his
piece
["Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions"](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_dumb_questions
"Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions"), playing on
[an ableist slur](http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-transcontinental-disability-choir-what-is-ableist-language-and-why-should-you-care
"The Transcontinental Disability Choir: What is Ableist Language and
Why Should You Care?") to make the point that he has nothing
interesting left to say:

> Whenever I am in a lecture or an adult-ed class, my hand is always
> one of the first to go up when we get to the Q&A part of the
> program. And often, afterward, people frequently come up to me and
> thank me for asking a question they were too timid to ask. I am sure
> that whatever question you have on your mind, there are several
> others in the audience who have the same question but hesitate
> because it might be a "dumb question."

At the risk of
[explaining the joke](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_whats_so_funny
"What's So Funny?"), this works on two levels.  After having railed
against the plague of "dumb" questions, it's suddenly revealed that
Paul Burri asks a lot of them himself.  And the people who have to
answer his questions probably can't stop themselves from wishing he
was dumb in the literal sense.  But that wouldn't stop him from typing.

I have nothing more to say about Paul Burri.
