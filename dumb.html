<p>Local entrepreneur, inventor, columnist, engineer, guerrilla marketer and iconoclast Paul Burri is running out of ideas (<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/112512_paul_burri_have_nothing_to_say" title="When You Have Nothing to Say">this isn’t the first time</a>). In his <em>Noozhawk</em> column, which he has apparently mistaken for a Tumblr, he’s already written about that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/021013_paul_burri_the_great_frying_pan_mystery" title="Cracking the Case of the Great Frying Pan Mystery">poached an egg</a>, that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/012013_paul_burri_the_electric_blanket_mix-up" title="The Electric Blanket Mix-Up Unfolds">didn’t make the bed correctly</a>, that time he went to Israel and <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/123012_paul_burri_recent_trip_to_israel" title="Observations After Our Recent Trip to Israel">decided that the Palestinians could learn a lot from the Israelis</a>, that time he got annoyed when <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/101412_paul_burri_why_didi_he_do_that" title="Questioning Why People Do the Things They Do">someone talked about him</a>, that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/081912_paul_burri_words_i_think_need_to_be_invented" title="Words I Think Need to Be Invented">made up words</a>, and that time when <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/042113_paul_burri_santa_barbara_homeless" title="An Unconventional Solution to Santa Barbara’s Transient Problem">he suggested that Santa Barbara conscript people into performing manual labor and then forcibly remove them from town</a>.</p>
<p>There really isn’t much more to talk about, but <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090212_paul_burri_man_killed_defective_toilet_seat" title="Man Killed by Defective Toilet Seat">that hasn’t stopped dear Paul before</a>. This week Paul titled his piece <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_dumb_questions" title="Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions">“Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions”</a>, playing on <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-transcontinental-disability-choir-what-is-ableist-language-and-why-should-you-care" title="The Transcontinental Disability Choir: What is Ableist Language and Why Should You Care?">an ableist slur</a> to make the point that he has nothing interesting left to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I am in a lecture or an adult-ed class, my hand is always one of the first to go up when we get to the Q&amp;A part of the program. And often, afterward, people frequently come up to me and thank me for asking a question they were too timid to ask. I am sure that whatever question you have on your mind, there are several others in the audience who have the same question but hesitate because it might be a “dumb question.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the risk of <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_whats_so_funny" title="What&#39;s So Funny?">explaining the joke</a>, this works on two levels. After having railed against the plague of “dumb” questions, it’s suddenly revealed that Paul Burri asks a lot of them himself. And the people who have to answer his questions probably can’t stop themselves from wishing he was dumb in the literal sense. But that wouldn’t stop him from typing.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say about Paul Burri.</p>
