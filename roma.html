<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-anne-rice-defends-paula-deen-against-lynch-mob-20130625,0,7208709.story" title="Anne Rice defends Paula Deen against &#39;lynch mob&#39;">lynching</a> of gentle soul <a href="http://gawker.com/i-is-what-i-is-paula-deen-sobs-in-tense-today-interv-583684774" title="&quot;I Is What I Is,&quot; Paula Deen Sobs in Tense *Today* Interview">Paula Deen</a> has had a chilling effect on other American racists. How are they to exercise their right to <a href="https://twitter.com/squeenlatifah/status/350024436939898881" title="Tweet by @squeenlatifa on 26 June 2013">free speech</a> when there are such consequences? Your average racist could not be blamed for simply packing it in.</p>
<p>But Julia Chaplin is not your average racist. Her bigotry is sophisticated and subtle, as demonstrated by <a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/bohemian-rhapsody/" title="Bohemian Rhapsody">a recent feature in <em>Santa Barbara Magazine</em></a>. The “style” she promotes involves some egregious cultural appropriation, particularly against Indigenous American peoples, and her books are boldly titled with the portmanteau <a href="http://www.gypset.com/">“gypset”</a>, the combination of “jet-set” and a <a href="http://www.rsdb.org/race/gypsy" title="The Racial Slur Database entry for &quot;gypsy&quot;">racial slur used against the Romani people</a>. But none of this is mentioned in the interview; Chaplin and “her band of friends, artists, musicians, and otherworldly vivants” are described as “a disheveled, chic, colorfully elegant tribe that turns heads”.</p>
<p>How did Julia Chaplin get away with this sort of behavior in our politically-correct dystopia? We sat down with her (<em>we did not</em>) and asked her how to be racist after Paula Deen.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn" title="Twitter for @dunndunndunn"><strong>CAT:</strong></a> First off, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Thank you! In a time when you can get in trouble for <a href="http://thisweekinblackness.com/2013/07/01/white-feminists-netroots/" title="This Week in Blackness: White Feminists: Step Your Game Up">using stock photography instead of finding a single image of a feminist of color</a>, I feel like I’ve really beat the odds here.</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> How do you think you got away with perpetuating racist stereotypes against <em>multiple</em> groups with very little protest? During my exhaustive research I found only one <a href="http://madamethursday.tumblr.com/post/26627290176/image-a-very-racist-appropriative-photo-of-a">Tumblr chain letter</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYW6F8COMLH/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=2759403963&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=">one-star review on Amazon of your book <em>Gypset Style</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> There are a few things I did that Paula Deen failed to do. First, the groups I went after are even more marginalized than the Black community is. Racism directed at Indigenous and <a href="http://gypsyappropriations.blogspot.com/2010/07/truth-about-gypsy-life.html" title="The Truth About &#39;Gypsy Life&#39;">Romani</a> peoples remains acceptable in a way anti-Black racism isn’t. Remember that just recently <a href="../docs/lucidity.html" title="When You&#39;re Lucid Dreaming You Can Do Anything But That Includes Being Racist">a music festival was hosted in your own backyard</a> that engaged in blatant appropriation of various Indigenous cultures, and another local magazine devoted <a href="http://www.ventanamonthly.com/issue.php?IssueNum=79" title="Ventana Magazine: On the Gypsy Trail">half an issue</a> to playing on <a href="https://staticnonsense.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/tw-the-bullshit-of-gypsy-magic-in-the-pagan-community/" title="[tw] the bullshit of &#39;gypsy magic&#39; in the pagan community">the racist trope of “gypsy magic.”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> Good points. And there’s probably something to be said for committing some appropriation against different groups, rather than going all-in on one.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Exactly, you want to diffuse the response. There’s no one group that I’ve single-mindedly victimized; that was the mistake of Lucidity Festival.</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> So the lessons are to choose multiple groups that remain incredibly vulnerable and spread the damage around.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Correct!</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> Well, this has been very enlightening. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> It’s been a pleasure.</p>
